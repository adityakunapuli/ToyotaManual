# Toyota Repair Manual Copy Tool


This tool allows one to copy the official technician's repair for any given vehicle. Note: you still require an active subscription to
[Toyota's TIS Website](https://techinfo.toyota.com/).

To get started, ensure that the following file is located in the your root directory (e.g., `/Users/<UserName>/toyota.yml`)
```python
username: TIS USERNAME
password: TIS PASSWORD
model: LEXUS / TOYOTA /  SCION
make: IS250
year: 2014
vin: VIN NUMBER
```
